Planning a trip is very necessary to be able to produce a trip that is certainly as expected and enjoyable. The obstacles that are often experienced by tourists when planning a tour are the difficulty of finding complete detailed information on the same platform, lack of information, and the need to estimate the time and distance from one location to another. Jentara aims to solve this challenge, by using data from tourist attractions obtained through scraping, the internet, and Google Maps API. For example, users select their travel preferences and then the application generates the best travel spot recommendation based on user preferences.

1. Machine Learning: Creating a sentiment analysis model that predicts ratings based on tourism place reviews. The model is built by fine-tuning the pre-trained IndoBERT model using the dataset we created. After that, the machine learning model API is created using the FastAPI Python library.
2. Mobile Development:  create a base layout for the Jentara APK, starting from UI until the logic behind it, and connect all of the components that have been provided by other divisions.
3. Cloud Computing: Creating an API for authentication using Firebase, and implementing optimal routes, search destinations, place details, and reviews using the Google Maps API. Deploying both auth-api and ml-api using Google Cloud Run. Storing user data in Cloud Firestore.
